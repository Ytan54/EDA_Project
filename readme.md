# Heart Attack Risk Prediction

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

This project aims to develop a predictive model for assessing heart attack risk using Body Mass Index (BMI) as main predictor and controlled demographic variables for covariates. The project uses the CDCâ€™s 2015 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset, which includes responses from 441,456 U.S. adults. The model incorporates variables BMI, age, sex, income, race, and insurance coverage to estimate the probability of having heart attack. By using large dataset and controlling for demographic confounding variables, this project build a comprehensive and robust prediction model. The project also examines multicollinearity, explores interaction effects, and validates performance using error tests.

## GOALS
1. Identify key predictors of heart attack risk using nationally representative survey data.
2. Develop a robust logistic regression model to estimate heart attack probability.
3. Assess model performance.
4. Explore interaction effects between BMI and demographic variables.
5. Provide reproducible code and documentation for public health researchers and data scientists.
